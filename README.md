# Welcome!
## So, What is this portfolio?

This portfolio/repository's purpose is to provide both housing for code projects and learning experiences.
During my 2025 spring semester, I will be adding projects related to my Elements of Computing II class. 
These projects will emphasize data storytelling and improve my ability to construct user-friendly
applications that can be used by a large audience.

## Organization

Main projects will have their own folders assigned with subfolders containing extra items such as data and
visuals. Class exercises will have their own folder and data, but will not be specifically specified other 
than data.

Thank you!

## Proudest Additions:
Slashing Data with Wolverine: https://github.com/MalteseWarrior/GOULD--PYTHON--PORTFOLIO/tree/main/TidyData-Project
This project was all about using pandas to restructure (tidy) messy data. I added a fun visualization tool with the help of Wolverine as the user goes through a quick game where they help him put the X-Men's data back together!
This application in particular expanded my knowledge of how to implement the pandas library (learned a lot from having to display data frames) and of how to create games, visuals, and the like in a python environment (pygame).

Goofy Googler: https://github.com/MalteseWarrior/GOULD--PYTHON--PORTFOLIO/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp
This project is about Name Entity Recognition and some transformer/sentiment analysis practice with a nautical theme! Insert SpongeBob-related text to learn more about those Bikini Bottom Entities!. 

# Other Additions:
Basic Streamlit App - https://github.com/MalteseWarrior/GOULD--PYTHON--PORTFOLIO/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app
An application that focused on the streamlit library system
