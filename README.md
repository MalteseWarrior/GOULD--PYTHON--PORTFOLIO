# Welcome!
## So, What is this portfolio?

This portfolio/repository's purpose is to provide both a housing for code projects and learning experiences.
During my 2025 spring semester I will be adding projects related to my Elements of Computing II class. 
These projects will emphasize data storytelling and improving my ability to construct user-friendly
applications that can be used by a large audience.

## Organization

Main projects will have their own folders assigned with subfolders containing extra items such as data and
visuals. Class exercises will have their own folder and data, but will not be specifically specified other 
than data.

Thank you!
