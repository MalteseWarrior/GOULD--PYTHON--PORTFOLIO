# Welcome!
## So, What is this portfolio?

This portfolio/repository's purpose is to provide both housing for code projects and learning experiences.
During my 2025 spring semester, I will be adding projects related to my Elements of Computing II class. 
These projects will emphasize data storytelling and improve my ability to construct user-friendly
applications that can be used by a large audience.

## Organization

Main projects will have their own folders assigned with subfolders containing extra items such as data and
visuals. Class exercises will have their own folder and data, but will not be specifically specified other 
than data.

Thank you!

## Proudest Additions:
[FlyBuy](https://github.com/MalteseWarrior/GOULD--PYTHON--PORTFOLIO/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal)
The final and most expansive project for this portfolio. The main purpose of the application is to construct a streamlit app that attempts to tell a story about a certain problem in my current field of study: Aerospace Engineering.
As such, I prioritize flight data and access live flight patterns from the OpenSky API and pair it with an analysis of the airports in the United States. Opensky reveals that the United States is the leading country for flight
departures, but it is also known for its high fare prices. Because of this, the user can analyze average fare prices and delay expectations for almost all airports in the United States. Also, there is an option to use a basic calculator
to determine annual revenue, despite delays depending on the airport.

[Slashing Data with Wolverine](https://github.com/MalteseWarrior/GOULD--PYTHON--PORTFOLIO/tree/main/TidyData-Project)
This project was all about using pandas to restructure (tidy) messy data. I added a fun visualization tool with the help of Wolverine as the user goes through a quick game where they help him put the X-Men's data back together!
This application in particular expanded my knowledge of how to implement the pandas library (learned a lot from having to display data frames) and of how to create games, visuals, and the like in a python environment (pygame).

[Goofy Googler](https://github.com/MalteseWarrior/GOULD--PYTHON--PORTFOLIO/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp)
This project is about Name Entity Recognition and some transformer/sentiment analysis practice with a nautical theme! Insert SpongeBob-related text to learn more about those Bikini Bottom Entities!. This is done alongside
basic sentiment analysis and cosine transformers.

# Other Additions:
[Basic Streamlit App](https://github.com/MalteseWarrior/GOULD--PYTHON--PORTFOLIO/tree/main/basic-streamlit-app)
An application that focused on the Streamlit library system that goes through various casino data sources from the University of Las Vegas. It was primarily made to have fun with streamlit and to learn its capabilities.
