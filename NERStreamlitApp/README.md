# üßΩ GoofyGoogler: A SpongeBob SquarePants NER App

This application was developed to learn more about Name Entity Recognition (NER) as part of spaCy‚Äôs language model. To do this, a large dataset was created by scraping the internet for SpongeBob SquarePants-related episodes, character names, and dialogue (This is found in the `GoofyScraper.py`). Once this data was collected, it was converted into a csv for easy loading. The actual NER section of the application is simple, as names, episodes, events, and locations are derived from the located transcripts.

As an add-on to this project, there is an incorporation of transformers, sentiment analysis, and fuzzy association. This was in an attempt to learn more about vectorization and confidence-based generation.

As a note, this application is specifically for locating SpongeBob-related words and statements, so please keep that in mind when inputting your text for analysis! Also, the visuals look the best when not in dark-mode.
