# üßΩ GoofyGoogler: A SpongeBob SquarePants NER App

This application was developed to learn more about Name Entity Recognition (NER) as part of spaCy‚Äôs language model. To do this, a large dataset was created by scraping the internet for SpongeBob SquarePants-related episodes, character names, and dialogue (This is found in the `GoofyScraper.py`). Once this data was collected, it was converted into a csv for easy loading. The actual NER section of the application is simple, as names, episodes, events, and locations are derived from the located transcripts.

As an add-on to this project, there is an incorporation of transformers, sentiment analysis, and fuzzy association. This was in an attempt to learn more about vectorization and confidence-based generation.

As a note, this application is specifically for locating SpongeBob-related words and statements, so please keep that in mind when inputting your text for analysis! Also, the visuals look the best when not in dark-mode.

To use GoofyGoogler to its fullest ability I encourage any user to talk about places, situations, characters, and lines in the SpongeBob SquarePants show! This application is designed to attempt to understand what the user is referring to in Spongebob and provide them with an associated episode, character(s), and descriptions. For example, if you were to talk about, "A little sea sponge went on an adventure with a grumpy squid to deliver pizza for the Krusty Krab," the GoofyGoogler will look through all the dialogue in the history of the show and find the most relative information that it can.
