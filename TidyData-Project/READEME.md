## What is Tidying Data with Wolverine?
This application was developed to explore pandas as a way to clean dastardly data sets and to try to 
develop a fun visualization alongside the process. The data set in question consists
of the particular characters in The X-men and their revenue in comic book sales
throughout the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s.
