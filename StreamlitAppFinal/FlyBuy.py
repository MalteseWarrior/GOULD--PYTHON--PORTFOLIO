## Welcome to FlyBuy!
# This is a streamlit python application that allows you to search for flights at real time using OpenSky API.
# Along with the flight data, it also provides details about the flight vehicle, such as its model, manufacturer, and other details.
# With this, the user is given the opportunity to analyze the average fare cost of the flight, and the average costs of actually flying the aircraft.

# As a note for clarity, the majoirty of html and css code was made with the help of ChatGPT.
# The fonts and layout was much quicker to create this way, I know the commands but it would have taken a lot longer to create the same layout and design.

## ------ WAIT! ------ ##
# Before running the code, make sure you have the required libraries installed. Especially if you are using a virtual environment.
# This is warning is for all you local users out there. If you are using the streamlit community cloud, you can ignore this warning.

        ### ‚úàÔ∏è **FlyBuy Application Overview**

        **FlyBuy** is a real-time air traffic and airport analysis platform that draws from global and domestic aviation data sources. The application is built to:

        - üåç Visualize **live departures around the world**
        - üõ¨ Highlight the **United States‚Äô dominant role in global air traffic**
        - üèôÔ∏è Drill into **U.S. airport-level metrics**, especially delays
        - üí∏ Assess the **economic costs of those delays**

        By integrating the OpenSky API with datasets from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, FlyBuy creates a comprehensive, interactive lens on air travel activity and performance.

        ---

        ### üåê **Live Flight Data Page**

        This page connects to the **OpenSky Network API** to display **live global flights** that are currently in the air.

        **Key Features:**
        - üìç **Interactive flight map** showing airborne aircraft, color-coded by their origin country
        - üåê **Country filter** to narrow down flights by country of origin
        - üìä **Live flight count** with metric updates
        - üìà **Bar chart** displaying flight volume per country

        **Why It Matters:**
        The U.S. has the **largest share of active airborne flights globally**. This foundational insight motivates deeper analysis into:
        - üõ´ U.S. airports with the most departures
        - ‚è±Ô∏è Delay frequencies and causes
        - üíµ The financial impact of delays on airlines and travelers
