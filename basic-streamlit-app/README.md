Basic Streamlet App is an application that provides a basic comparison between multiple types of casino revenue between the years 2000 & 2022. The app was created as a way to practice creating user interaction, webpage visuals, and data analysis.
The user has the ability to define the casino games of choice. At the moment, it includes a dual comparison or a comparison between one game type to all other game types. Along with this, the user can specify the variable in question. Once selected, a graph
will appear with a little surprise!
